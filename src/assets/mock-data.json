      "Description": "The Sun Gym Gang were active in Miami, Florida, during the mid-1990s[1] and were responsible for the murders of Frank Griga and Krisztina Furton along with the kidnapping and extortion of Marc Schiller.[2] The gang was composed mostly of bodybuilders who frequented the Sun Gym in Miami Lakes, Florida[3] including Daniel Lugo and Adrian Doorbal. Pete Collins published a three-part series in the Miami New Times in 1999 and 2000 chronicling the stories of the gang titled 'Pain and Gain'[4] which was then loosely adapted into the 2013 film Pain & Gain directed by Michael Bay.[5]",
